Health Call Agent Node replica has been updated to the requested conditional workflow.

Implemented:
1. Agent 1: Purpose identification.
2. Agent 2: Failure analysis with two tracks:
   - Business/Operational
   - Agentic Workflow
3. Decision logic:
   - If agentic issues -> Agent 3 runs.
   - Else -> frontend displays outputs without Agent 3.
4. Agent 3: Workflow improvement actions.
5. Frontend dashboard updated to show Output 1/2/3.
6. Dataflow documentation added (DATAFLOW.dot + visualization guide).
